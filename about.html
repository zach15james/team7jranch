        <h2>OUR PRINCIPLES</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>We give our best: </strong>"Whatever you do, work heartily, as to the Lord and not to men" (Colossians 3:23).  We strive to honor Christ in the way we treat our animals.
          <ul>
            <li>Or cows are treated humanely, operating in a low-stress envrionment, and loved by our entire family</li>
            <li>100% Grass Fed (besides occasionally indulging in fresh treats, like Flordia-clementine peels</li>
          </ul></li>
          <li><strong>We honor those who serve: </strong>10% discount to all active duty, reserve, and retired U.S. military & government servicemembers (& spouses).</li>
          <li><strong>No BS: </strong>"whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things" (Philippians 4:8).
          <ul>
            <li>None of our cows have received Bill Gates' Covid Vaccine</li>
            <li>We use minimal (to no) pesticides when treating our grounds</li>
          </ul></li>
